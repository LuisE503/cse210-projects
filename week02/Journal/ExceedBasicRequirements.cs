// Added improvements to go beyond the basic requirements:
// 1. Saving and loading in JSON:
//    I decided to use JSON format for saving and loading the journal data. This format is pretty common and easy to work with. 
//    It also makes the data look more organized and can be used in other programs if needed.
// 2. Journal statistics:
//    I added a menu option that shows some statistics about the journal, like:
//       - How many entries the journal has.
//       - The date of the first entry.
//       - The date of the most recent entry.
//    I think this is helpful for users to see how they are doing with their journaling habit.
// 3. More prompts:
//    I added more prompts to make it more interesting. Now there are more options to choose from, which can help if someone doesnâ€™t know what to write about.
